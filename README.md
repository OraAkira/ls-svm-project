# ls-svm-project
v2.0 
In developing. The computational part of modifications has been implemented in ties version of the software.
Currently the development of the application interface is being finalized.
Added:
- set of admissible values of the RBF-kernel parameter (called sigma^2) is replaced bi the generation of a grid;
- weighted procedure LS SVM (robust LS SVM);
- auto-tuning procedure for a boundary parameter of the weighted algorithm;
- generalized regularity criterion is formulated and added;
- weighted criterion LOO CV is formulated and added;
- graphics visualization of results of above-mentioned procedures.
