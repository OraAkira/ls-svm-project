# ls-svm-project
v2.0 
In developing. Software implemented the practical part of the modifications.
Currently being finalized application interface. Added:

- set of valid parameter values sigma^2 RBF-kernel replaced the generation of the grid;
- weighted procedure LS SVM (robust LS SVM);
- auto-tuning procedure is the boundary of the parameter for the weighted algorithm;
- formulated and added generic regularity criterion;
- formulated and added to the weighted criteria loo CV;
- graphics rendering results added procedures.
